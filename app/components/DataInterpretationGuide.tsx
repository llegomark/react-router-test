                    <li><strong>Establish a Routine:</strong> If the chart shows inconsistent practice, try scheduling dedicated study times. Aim for realistic, sustainable goals (e.g., 30-60 minutes daily) rather than overly ambitious ones.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintain Momentum:</strong> Use the visual feedback to motivate yourself to fill in the gaps and maintain a consistent study streak.</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid Burnout:</strong> If you see excessively high activity every single day, ensure you're also scheduling rest days to prevent burnout. Balance is important.</li>

                    <li><strong>Focus on the Lowest Bars:</strong> Dedicate specific study sessions to the 1-3 categories where your performance is weakest. Dive deep into the concepts and practice questions related to these areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintain Strengths:</strong> Don't completely ignore your strong areas. Periodically review them to ensure retention, but allocate less time compared to weaker domains.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cross-Reference with Exam Weighting:</strong> Consider the official NQESH domain weightings (if known). A weak area that constitutes a large part of the exam needs even higher priority.</li>

                    <strong>What it shows:</strong> A histogram chart displaying the distribution of the *total time* taken to complete entire quiz sessions. It groups sessions into time duration brackets (e.g., 0-15 mins, 15-30 mins, 30-45 mins, etc.) and shows how many sessions fall into each bracket.

                <ul className={listDiscClass}>
                    <li><strong>Typical Pacing:</strong> Reveals how long you typically spend on a full quiz session. Is there a common time range?</li>
                    <li><strong>Identify Outliers:</strong> Shows if some sessions are unusually fast or slow compared to your average.</li>
                    <li><strong>Time Management Habits:</strong> Provides insight into your general time allocation per session. Are you rushing, or are you spending extensive time?</li>
                </ul>

                <ul className={listDiscClass}>
                    <li><strong>Correlate with Scores:</strong> This chart is most useful when considered alongside score data (see the next scatter plot). Are your fastest sessions associated with lower scores (rushing)? Are your longest sessions associated with higher scores (carefulness) or lower scores (struggling)?</li>
                    <li><strong>Establish Realistic Time Goals:</strong> Understand your natural pace to better plan study schedules.</li>
                    <li><strong>Investigate Outliers:</strong> If you have many very short or very long sessions, reflect on why. Were you interrupted? Did you get stuck? Were you trying a speed run?</li>

                <p>
                    <strong>What it shows:</strong> A scatter plot where each dot represents a single completed quiz session. The X-axis plots the total time spent on that quiz, and the Y-axis plots the final score (%) achieved.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
                <ul className={listDiscClass}>
                    <li><strong>Correlation between Time and Score:</strong> Look for overall patterns or trends:
                        <ul className="list-['-_'] space-y-1 pl-4 mt-1"> {/* Kept nested list style for clarity */}
                            <li><strong>Upward Trend (Positive Correlation):</strong> Spending more time generally leads to better scores (suggests carefulness pays off).</li>
                            <li><strong>Downward Trend (Negative Correlation):</strong> Spending more time leads to worse scores (might indicate getting bogged down, struggling excessively with harder quizzes).</li>
                            <li><strong>No Clear Trend:</strong> Time spent doesn't seem to strongly influence the score, or the relationship is complex.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Identify Optimal Time Zone:</strong> Is there a range of time spent that consistently yields high scores?</li>
                    <li><strong>Spot Outliers:</strong>
                        <ul className="list-['-_'] space-y-1 pl-4 mt-1"> {/* Kept nested list style for clarity */}
                            <li><em>High Score, Low Time:</em> Efficient and knowledgeable, or perhaps an easy quiz?</li>
                            <li><em>Low Score, Low Time:</em> Rushing, lack of effort, or carelessness?</li>
                            <li><em>Low Score, High Time:</em> Significant difficulty, struggling with concepts?</li>
                            <li><em>High Score, High Time:</em> Thoroughness, or perhaps time pressure isn't a major issue yet?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Actionable Insights:</strong></p>
                <ul className={listDiscClass}>
                    <li><strong>Adjust Pacing Strategy:</strong> If low time consistently correlates with low scores, consciously slow down, read carefully, and double-check answers. If high time correlates with low scores, identify bottlenecks â€“ are you spending too long on questions you don't know? Practice time management techniques like skipping very hard questions and returning later.</li>
                    <li><strong>Find Your Sweet Spot:</strong> Aim for the time range that seems to produce your best results, balancing speed and accuracy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Analyze Outliers:</strong> Reflect on the specific quizzes represented by outlier dots. What happened during those sessions?</li>

            <GuideSectionCard icon={<ScatterChartIcon />} title="Per-Question Accuracy vs. Time Spent Scatter Plot">
                <p>
                    <strong>What it shows:</strong> A scatter plot where each dot represents a *single question* you've answered. The X-axis plots the time you spent on that specific question, and the Y-axis indicates whether you answered it correctly (e.g., Y=1) or incorrectly (e.g., Y=0), or sometimes uses color/shape to differentiate correct/incorrect.

                    <li><strong>Diagnose Error Types:</strong> This powerful visual helps distinguish between different reasons for errors:
                        <ul className="list-['-_'] space-y-1 pl-4 mt-1"> {/* Kept nested list style for clarity */}
                            <li><strong>Quick & Incorrect (Bottom-Left Cluster):</strong> Suggests careless mistakes, misreading the question, rushing, or guessing quickly without understanding.</li>
                            <li><strong>Slow & Incorrect (Bottom-Right Cluster):</strong> Indicates struggling with the concept, spending time but still not arriving at the correct answer. Suggests fundamental knowledge gaps or difficulty applying concepts.</li>
                            <li><strong>Quick & Correct (Top-Left Cluster):</strong> Represents questions you know well and can answer efficiently.</li>
                            <li><strong>Slow & Correct (Top-Right Cluster):</strong> Represents challenging questions that you were able to solve correctly with sufficient time and effort.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Identify Time Sinks:</strong> Are there many questions where you spend a very long time, regardless of correctness? These might be areas where you lack confidence or efficiency.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Actionable Insights:</strong></p>
                <ul className={listDiscClass}>
                    <li><strong>Address Quick Errors:</strong> If you have many dots in the "Quick & Incorrect" zone, practice active reading techniques. Slow down slightly, highlight keywords, and re-read the question before answering. Double-check simple calculations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Address Slow Errors:</strong> If you have many dots in the "Slow & Incorrect" zone, this points to core conceptual weaknesses. These topics require focused study, reviewing fundamentals, and working through explanations â€“ refer back to the "Most Challenging Questions" list and category weaknesses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improve Efficiency:</strong> Analyze the "Slow & Correct" questions. Could you have solved them faster with better techniques or deeper understanding? Are there calculation shortcuts or reasoning patterns you could learn?</li>
                    <li><strong>Build Confidence:</strong> Recognize the "Quick & Correct" areas as strengths to build upon.</li>
